Interactive Code Editor
This project is a Streamlit-based interactive code editor that supports multiple programming languages. Users can write, edit, and execute code directly in the browser.

Features
Multi-language Support: Execute code in Python, Java, and JavaScript.
ACE Editor Integration: Includes syntax highlighting, theming, and adjustable settings.
Interactive Execution: Compile and run code on the fly with output displayed in real-time.
Customizable UI: Modify themes, font sizes, and editor dimensions through the sidebar.
Technologies Used
Streamlit
Streamlit-Ace for embedding the ACE editor
Python subprocess for executing external commands
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd interactive-code-editor
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit streamlit-ace
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Access the App: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.

Usage
Select the programming language from the sidebar.
Customize the editor's theme, font size, and height as needed.
Write your code in the editor.
Click the "Run Code" button to execute the code.
View the output below the editor.
Supported Languages
Python: Execute scripts with the python interpreter.
Java: Compile and run .java files with javac and java.
JavaScript: Execute scripts using node.js.

Suggestions for Improvement
Security: Currently, code execution is local. If deploying to a public server, sandboxing or restricted execution environments are crucial to prevent malicious code execution.
Advanced Features:
Add support for additional languages (e.g., C, C++).
Enable input support for programs requiring user interaction.
Save and load code snippets.
